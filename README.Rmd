# courier

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A suite of tools for generating placekeys using the bulk data API and progress reporting via Slack bots. A work in progress.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `courier` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mcclatchy-southeast/courier")
```

## Usage

After installation, you can load the library like any other package.

``` r
##load courier package
library(courier)
```

<!--You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.-->
